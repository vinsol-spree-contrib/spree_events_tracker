SpreeEventsTracker
==================

Spree Events Tracker is a spree extension used to track various user activities. This extension can be used to track
1) Keywords searched by User
2) Products detail page and other pages visited by User
3) Product added/removed/updated to cart
4) Checkout flow during completion of an order

## Installation


1. Add this extension to your Gemfile with this line:

  #### Spree >= 3.1

  ```ruby
  gem 'spree_events_tracker', github: 'vinsol-spree-contrib/spree_events_tracker'
  ```

  #### Spree 3.0 and Spree 2.x

  ```ruby
  gem 'spree_events_tracker', github: 'vinsol-spree-contrib/spree_events_tracker', branch: 'X-X-stable'
  ```

  The `branch` option is important: it must match the version of Spree you're using.
  For example, use `3-0-stable` if you're using Spree `3-0-stable` or any `3.0.x` version.


2. Install the gem using Bundler:
  ```ruby
  bundle install
  ```

3. Copy & run migrations
  ```ruby
  bundle exec rails g spree_events_tracker:install
  ```

4. Restart your server

  If your server was running, restart it so that it can find the assets properly.


## Testing

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rspec spec
```
